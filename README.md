# Interview assesment

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to tackle this assesment as part of the job interview process. For the project I used nextjs.js since it is a reactjs framewok I have used in the past and enjoyed using it. My skilllevel in reactjs is basic at best, I am more adapt at Vue.js but I believe frameworks are just tools to solve a problem, as long as you understand the problem really well, framework concepts should be easily transferred. For CSS I prefer tailwindCSS but occassionaly go down to pure CSS if needs be, but I have found tailwindCSS to be extremely powerful at time. 

The algroithm part of the project was the most challenging and enjoyable part, the solution I provided is somewhat lacking but its a able to provide atleast one degree of separation.
